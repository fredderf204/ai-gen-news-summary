  AI Generated Azure News Summary
  <br>
</h1>

<h4 align="center">An Azure Function centred process that takes news articles from places like <a href="https://azurefeeds.com/" target="_blank">Azure Feeds</a> and creates a summary of them using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service" target="_blank">Azure Open AI</a>.</h4>

## Key Features

* Multiple Sources
  * This sample connects to one source (Azure Feeds), but this architecture could be scaled to connect to many sources.
* Summary Generated by Azure Open AI
  * Each news article is summarised by Azure Open AI.
* Email notification of summary
  * The summary is emailed to a list of recipients.
* Azure Functions
  * The process is run as an Azure Functions (Platform as a Service) so there is no admin overhead.

## Pre-req Azure components

This repo has the code for all three functions used in this process, but there are some pre-req components that need to be created in Azure before you can deploy the code.

:bulb: There is a current issue open to support multiple deployment options.

* Azure Function App
  * Add the below Function App Configuration Application settings once known.
    * "targetrss": "",
    * "logicappurl": "",
    * "containerurl": "",
    * "storageaccount": "", <---this is the connection string of your storage account.
    * "aoaiendpoint": "",
    * "aoaikey": "",
    * "aoaimodel": "",
    * "queuename": "rssprocess"
* Azure Storage Account
  * Blob Storage Container (remember the url path to this container. I.e. https://awesomename.blob.core.windows.net)
  * SAS Key (remember the key)
  * Queue with name rssprocess (this is hardcoded in the queueworker function.json)
* Azure Open AI resource (remember the endpoint name, key and model name.)
* Azure Logic App (remember the URL)
